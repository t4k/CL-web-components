# Deployment Workflows

This guide explains how to deploy **CL-web-components** depending on what changed.

---

# Prerequisites

A `media.env` file must exist in the project root before deploying to S3.

It must contain:

```
BUCKET_NAME
BASE_URL
DISTRIBUTION_ID
```

This file is included in gitignore and is **not committed to git**.

---
  
# Deploy Documentation Changes

Use this workflow when **only documentation (`.md`) files have changed**.

Documentation is published automatically. Pushing to `main` triggers the
[Build and deploy docs](.github/workflows/docs.yml) GitHub Actions workflow, which
runs Pandoc over every `*.md` file, rebuilds the Pagefind search index, and
deploys the result straight to GitHub Pages. There is no `gh-pages` branch and
no publishing script to run.

## Step 1. Preview locally (optional)

```bash
make website
```

This converts all `*.md` files to `*.html` using **Pandoc** so you can open them
in a browser before pushing. It is only a preview -- the published site is built
from scratch by CI, not from these files.

## Step 2. Save and push your working branch

If you added **new files**, stage them first:

```bash
git add <filename>
```

Then commit and push:

```bash
make save msg="your commit message"
```

> `make save` uses `git commit -am` which only commits already-tracked files. New files must be staged with `git add` first.

## Step 3. Confirm the deployment

Once your change is on `main`, watch the run finish under the repository's
**Actions** tab, or from the command line:

```bash
gh run watch
```

The site updates at <https://caltechlibrary.github.io/CL-web-components/> when the
workflow completes, typically within a minute.

# Deploy Updated Web Component Code

Use this workflow when **component code in `src/` has changed** and needs to be deployed to the CDN.

## Step 1. Build compiled JavaScript

```bash
make build
```

This command runs `deno task build` and bundles:

- `src/*.js` > matching root-level `.js` files
- `mod.js` > `cl-web-components.js` (combined build)

## Step 2. Preview the S3 upload (optional)

```bash
./publish_to_s3.bash dry-run
```

This shows which files will be uploaded without making changes.

## Step 3. Save and push your working branch

If you added **new files**, stage them first:

```bash
git add <filename>
```

Then commit and push:

```bash
make save msg="your commit message"
```

> `make save` uses `git commit -am` which only commits already-tracked files. New files must be staged with `git add` first.

Pushing to `main` also rebuilds and redeploys the documentation site automatically.

## Step 4. Deploy to S3 and refresh the CDN

```bash
./publish_to_s3.bash
```

This script:

- Uploads root `*.js` and `css/*.css` files
- Places them under `/cl-webcomponents/` in the S3 bucket
- Creates a **CloudFront cache invalidation** so the CDN serves the new files

---

# Deploy a New Release  

Use this workflow when creating a **versioned GitHub release**.

## Step 1. Update release metadata

Edit `codemeta.json` and update:

- Version number
- Release notes

## Step 2. Build compiled output

```bash
make build
```

This command also regenerates several files from `codemeta.json`:

- `README.md`
- `version.js`
- `CITATION.cff`
- `about.md`

## Step 3. Build the distribution bundle

```bash
make dist
```

This command:

- Bundles files into `dist/`
- Copies documentation files:
  - `INSTALL.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `about.md`
  - `codemeta.json`
  - `CITATION.cff`
  - `LICENSE`
- Creates a release archive:

```
cl-web-components-<version>.zip
```

## Step 4. Save and push your working branch

If you added **new files**, stage them first:

```bash
git add <filename>
```

Then commit and push:

```bash
make save msg="your commit message"
```

> `make save` uses `git commit -am` which only commits already-tracked files. New files must be staged with `git add` first.

## Step 5. Create a draft GitHub release

```bash
./release.bash
```

This script:

- Reads the version and release notes from `codemeta.json`
- Commits changes
- Creates a **draft GitHub release** using the `gh` CLI
- Uploads the `.zip` archive

## Step 6. Publish the release

Open the GitHub releases page and publish the draft:

https://github.com/caltechlibrary/CL-web-components/releases
